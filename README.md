The Tesco Store Locator is a React web app for finding Tesco stores by postcode. It features an interactive map centered on London, displaying store locations only after a search. Each store entry provides opening hours, contact info, services (pharmacy, Click &amp; Collect), and accessibility details, all within a clean, branded interface.
